        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
        men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
        moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
        trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
        fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
        through shrinking from toil and pain.

        These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
        hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents
        our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed
        and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the
        claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
        that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

        The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
        of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or
        else he endures pains to avoid worse pains. But I must explain to you
        how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
        born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound
        the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
        master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
        pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
        know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
        extremely painful.
